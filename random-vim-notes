the :read command can insert a file or the result from running an external program into the current buffer. 
to run a program, preface the shell command with ! (see :help :read!). for example,

:read !date


---------------------------------

a filter is a program which reads text from standard input, then processes the text, and sends the result to standard output. 
in vim, a range of lines can be selected, then replaced with the output from running a filter (the selected lines are the input to the filter).

for example, the following text may appear in a file that is being edited:

one,two,three,four,five
arborist,apple,artichoke,ant,author
branch,banana,broccoli,bee,book
canopy,cherry,cabbage,cricket,codex

the following procedure uses the cut utility (available on many unix-based systems) to replace each line with fields 2 to 3 inclusive:

    on the first line, press v to start a visual selection.
    press j to move the cursor down until all wanted lines are selected.
    press ! (the command line will show :'<,'>! indicating that the selected range will be filtered).
    enter a command to be executed by the shell, such as cut -f2-3 -d, (select fields 2-3 using comma as a delimiter between fields).

vim saves the selected lines to a temporary file, then runs the external command with the temporary file as input. 
the result from running the command replaces the selected lines. in this example, the result is:

One,Two,Three,Four,Five
arborist,apple,artichoke,ant,author
branch,banana,broccoli,bee,book
canopy,cherry,cabbage,cricket,codex

---------------------------------------------

you can use this feature to replace a command with its output. for example on windows if the buffer contains

boolean-operators.py
comparison-operator.py
data.txt
hello.py
math-operations.py
operator-priority.py
random-vim-notes
typecasting.py
unary-bitwise-operators.py

and you issue the command :%!cmd the five lines will be replaced with the output of the five commands.

the same method can be used on unix with appropriate changes (for bash you would issue the command %!bash, and in this example the ping command would be ping -c 1). 


!!ls
boolean-operators.py
comparison-operator.py
data.txt
hello.py
math-operations.py
operator-priority.py
random-vim-notes
typecasting.py
unary-bitwise-operators.py

> will indent when you highlight the row

ctrl a to increment number
ctrl x to decrement number
1
2
3
4
5



One,Two,Three,Four,Five
arborist,apple,artichoke,ant,author
branch,banana,broccoli,bee,book
canopy,cherry,cabbage,cricket,codex
